This lesson was built with [The Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs). The content was adapted from the [Software Carpentry Version Control with Git lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/), the [Carpentries Incubator Version Control with Git lesson](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/git-novice-branch-pr/) that incorporates branches and PRs, and the [Library Carpentry Introduction to Git lesson](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-git/). 
This lesson is designed to contain only the minimal amount of information to get learners functional with Git & GitHub, and should not be considered a comprehensive introduction to git.

The goal of this lesson is to introduce core git concepts and commands while following a common git workflow pattern. Learners will start with creating a repository on GitHub, then use VS Code to clone the repo, make edits locally, and push those changes to the remote GitHub repo. 

Bash is not a pre-requisite for this lesson, and any bash commands used (like `pwd` or `ls -a`) are purely optional. The VS Code interface is used to create new files, and provides a GUI interface that learners should be more comfortable with compared to a purely terminal-based workflow.

By the end of the lesson, learners should be ready to follow the same workflow in a repo of their own creation/choosing, and understand the core git commands: `config`, `status`, `log`, `add`, `commit`, `diff`, `push`, `pull`, and `branch`. They should be comfortable using both the terminal and the VS Code Source Control pane to perform these git operations.
